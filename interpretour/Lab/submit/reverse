I do not think that it is possible to use a foreach to get
the reverse of an array with this language. I wanted to
make an array that was the same length as an input array 
and set its values in reverse something like this;

  var length = Length(inp);
  var array = new array[length];

  foreach i => v in inp {
    array[length-i] = v;
  }

but that is not possible in this language.
